I AM DESPERATE FOR HELP ON THIS PROJECT!

I have no clue what I am doing whatsoever.

I just wanted to make a DVD logo thing and it looks great on the dolphin emulator.

but when i run it on the Wii with a CRT, the CRT has an issue where the top part of the refresh, a few lines on the top of the CRT, it umm. Yadaa yaddaa yadaa... Those lines of refresh display over what should be displaying which is the Wii icon. I CAN PROVIDE A VIDEO IF YOU WANT JUST MESSAGE ME ON GODAMN DISCORD! Greego#4917 THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

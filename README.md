This is a program that makes a similar thing to DVD bouncing logo, but for the Wii and with the Wii logo.

You can build the source with DEVKITPRO and GRRLIB libraries installed. 

Have fun!!!

Two ways of installing:
1. Download it from OSCWII (homebrew browser)
2. Download it from releases, and copy the files to /apps on your SD.

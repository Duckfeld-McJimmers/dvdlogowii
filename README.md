This is a program that is a similar thing to the iconic DVD bouncing logo screensaver, but for the Wii and with various logos.

Press "A" to switch through the themes.


You can build the source with DEVKITPRO and GRRLIB libraries installed. 
Note when building: There will be some warnings about unused theme variables, you can ignore those as they are used.

Have fun!!!




Two ways of installing:
1. Download it from OSCWII (homebrew browser)
2. Download it from releases, and copy the files to /apps on your SD.

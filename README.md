# BounceWii


This is a program that brings the iconic DVD logo screensaver to the Wii!

Including many themes:

* Wii theme (default)
* Gamecube theme
* DVD theme
* Wii U theme (new)
* Duck theme (new) 

## Using

This is an extremely simple application to use. You simply sit back and enjoy. 

When you want to change themes, you simply press "A" on your wiimote or your GC controller.

## Building
You need **DEVKITPRO** and **GRRLIB** setup on your computer, I am not going to tell you how to do that.

Simply run `make` and enjoy.


## Installation
Requires a homebrewed Wii, or the dolphin emulator.

### Available on the Open Shop Channel (and homebrew browser)

### From GitHub
1. Download the zip file of the latest release.
2. Unzip the zip file and copy the files in the /apps/ folder on the SD of your Wii.
3. Make sure the folder in the apps folder is the one that contains the files of the app, not another folder that contains the files.
4. If using dolphin, simply run the boot.dol file.
